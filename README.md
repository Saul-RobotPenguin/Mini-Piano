An Online Piano Player That Has "Musical Sheets" Allowing You To Show Off Your Musical Skills

## Description

Ever saw Beethoven and thought, "I could do it way more better"

Well, me too, unfortunately, I don't know anything about tones or musical shapes.

I just know that if I close my eyes and let my forehead get a bit sweaty then proceed to slam my fingers, against the keys in a pattern, I'll eventually be thrown roses and be given a round of applause.

Unfortunately, other people don't have the same musical gift that I do, so to those poor souls, I present to you....

MINI PIANO!!!!!

A website where you can play the piano using the keyboard of your PC!

I even provided musical sheets of popular songs so that you don't have to "learn" to play

Just click the right keys using your keyboard and soon, you will be playing alongside me, as a true musician!

We'll just have to somehow disguise your laptop as a Grand Piano.......
